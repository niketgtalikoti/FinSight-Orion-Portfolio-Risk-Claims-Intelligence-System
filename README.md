##  Project Origin

***This project is fully conceptualized, designed, and executed by me from end to end.
All the data, business rules, and portfolio structure were created entirely from my imagination to simulate a real-world financial risk analytics environment.
The goal was to challenge myself to build a complete, production-style analytics system — from synthetic data generation to SQL-driven modeling and Power BI intelligence dashboards.***

---
## 🧠 **Project Overview**

**FinSight Orion** is an end-to-end analytics system built to uncover
**risk patterns, claims behavior, and profitability drivers** within a financial lending portfolio of **10,000+ contracts**.

The project combines:

* **SQL-based deep portfolio analysis**, and
* **Power BI interactive dashboards**

to give decision-makers a complete 360° view of defaults, claims, credit risk, and product performance.

---

## 📂 **Dataset Summary**

The portfolio contains fields such as:

* Customer demographics (CustomerID, CreditScore, Region)
* Contract attributes (ProductType, Tenure, InterestRate, ContractAmount)
* Risk outcomes (IsDefault, HasClaim, ClaimAmount)
* Channel & origination details
* Payment behavior (LastPaymentDate, StartDate)

Total Records: **10,000**
Default Events: **2,000**
Claim Events: **222**

---

## 🛠 **SQL Analysis – What Was Done**

### ✔ Portfolio-Level Metrics

* Total contracts, defaults, claims
* Default rate & claim rate
* Profitability estimation (EMI earned – principal – claims)

### ✔ Segmentation Analysis

* Default rate by region
* Product-wise profitability
* Channel-wise default behavior
* Asset-type claim severity

### ✔ Credit Risk Analytics

* Impact of credit score on default likelihood
* High-risk customer clustering
* Identifying top 100 high-risk customers

### ✔ Claims Intelligence

* Claims severity by asset type
* Loss-making contracts
* Claim concentration patterns

## 📊 **Power BI Dashboard – Key Visuals**

### **Dashboard Pages**

1. **Portfolio Overview Dashboard**

   * Default Rate by Region (Map)
   * Claims Severity by Asset Type
   * Profitability per Product
   * Credit Score vs Default Rate (Scatter)
   * Contracts vs Defaults by Channel
   * Top KPIs (Contracts, Defaults, Claims, Profit)

2. **Executive Summary Page**

   * Story-style insight narration
   * High-level patterns, risks, and opportunities

---

## 🔍 **Key Insights Derived**

### **1️⃣ Regional Risk Concentration**

* **West and North regions** emerged as highest-risk pockets.
* Other regions showed steady repayment behavior.

### **2️⃣ Credit Score as a Risk Predictor**

* Customers with **credit scores < 600** defaulted significantly more.
* Strong indicator for underwriting improvements.

### **3️⃣ Channel Performance**

* **Dealer** and **Broker** channels showed higher default ratios.
* Online & MobileApp channels demonstrated better-quality borrowers.

### **4️⃣ Product Profitability**

* Loan and lease products delivered strong profit.
* Certain asset types (especially vehicles) showed **higher claims**.

### **5️⃣ Claims Behavior**

* Claims were rare but **high-severity**, concentrated among
  a few asset categories like Cars and Trucks.

## 🧾 **Conclusion**

FinSight Orion transformed raw financial data into **actionable risk intelligence**.
The project revealed where risk originates, which customers are vulnerable,
which products generate value, and where claims drain profitability.

Through segmentation, channel optimization, and better underwriting rules,
this portfolio can evolve from **reactive risk management** to
**proactive, predictive decision-making**.
